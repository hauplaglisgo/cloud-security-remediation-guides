# How to Edit Your Diablo 3 Save File on Xbox 360
 
If you are looking for a way to modify your Diablo 3 save file on Xbox 360, you may have come across some tools that claim to do the job. However, not all of them are reliable or safe to use. In this article, we will show you how to use a trusted and updated tool called D3Edit, which is a fork of the original D3Studio by Visual Studio.
 
D3Edit is a graphical user interface (GUI) version of D3Studio, which allows you to edit your Diablo 3 save file on your PC and transfer it back to your Xbox 360. You can change your character's stats, gold, items, affixes, and more. You can also add items by ID or browsing the database. The tool has a lot of features and possibilities, but you should always use it with caution and make a backup of your original save file before editing.
