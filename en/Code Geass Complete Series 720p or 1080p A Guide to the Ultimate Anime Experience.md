If you are a fan of Code Geass or want to experience this epic anime for the first time, you might be wondering which version to watch: 720p or 1080p. Both versions have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on your preferences and device. Here are some factors to consider before choosing:
 
- **Resolution:** 720p stands for 1280x720 pixels, while 1080p stands for 1920x1080 pixels. The higher the resolution, the more details and sharpness you can see on the screen. However, higher resolution also means larger file size and more bandwidth consumption. If you have a limited storage space or internet speed, you might prefer 720p over 1080p.
- **Quality:** Both versions are encoded from the same Blu-ray source, which means they have the same original quality. However, some fans prefer the 1080p version because it preserves more details and colors than the 720p version, which might have some compression artifacts or noise. On the other hand, some fans prefer the 720p version because it has less aliasing or jagged edges than the 1080p version, which might look too sharp or unnatural on some screens.
- **Compatibility:** Both versions are compatible with most devices and media players that support MP4 format. However, some older devices or players might not be able to handle the 1080p version smoothly or at all. If you have an older device or player, you might want to check its specifications and compatibility before downloading the 1080p version.

In conclusion, both versions of Code Geass are great options to enjoy this masterpiece of anime in high definition. The choice depends on your personal preference and device capability. You can download both versions from various sources online, such as Nyaa[^1^], SoundCloud[^2^] [^4^], or Trello[^3^]. Whichever version you choose, you will not regret watching Code Geass: a captivating story that will make you laugh, cry, think, and feel.
