## What is Vehicle Swept Path Analysis and Turn Simulation?
 
Vehicle swept path analysis and turn simulation are methods of evaluating the movement and turning requirements of different types of vehicles in various design scenarios. They help you to ensure that your design is safe, efficient and compliant with standards and regulations. Vehicle swept path analysis shows you the area that a vehicle occupies as it moves along a predefined path, while turn simulation shows you the speed, acceleration, deceleration and steering characteristics of a vehicle as it performs a maneuver.
