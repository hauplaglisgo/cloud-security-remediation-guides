Dragon Age 2 is a game that offers a lot of choices and consequences, especially when it comes to romance. You can woo and win the hearts of four different companions: Anders, Fenris, Isabela, and Merrill. Each romance has its own unique storyline, dialogue, and cutscenes. But what if you want more?
 
Maybe you want to pursue multiple romances at once, or repeat your favorite scenes whenever you want, or see your lover in a different light. Maybe you just want to add some extra flavor and variety to your romantic encounters. Whatever your reason, there are mods that can help you achieve your desired outcome.

In this article, we will introduce you to some of the best romance mods for Dragon Age 2 that can enhance your experience and make your love life more exciting. Whether you want to be polyamorous, passionate, or playful, there is a mod for you.
 
## Poly Romance Mod
 
If you can't decide between your love interests, or you want to experience all of them at once, then this mod is for you. The Poly Romance Mod[^1^] allows you to pursue multiple romances simultaneously, without any jealousy or conflict. You can kiss and cuddle with whoever you want, in any order you want. All initiated romances will continue until you choose to end them yourself.
 
This mod does not modify any individual dialogue files for Anders, Fenris, Isabela, and Merrill, so it should be compatible with most other dialogue mods for them. However, if you want to romance Sebastian as well, you will need to download Sebastian Revisited[^1^] and the compatibility patch[^1^], as his dialogue file requires edits for full functionality with this mod.
 
## Repeatable Romance Scenes
 
If you want to relive your favorite romance scenes over and over again, then this mod is for you. The Repeatable Romance Scenes mod[^2^] adds several at-will romance scenes triggered from within the Hawke Estate. You can interact with the bed after the romance has been confirmed (meaning after Anders and Merrill have moved in with you) and choose from four options: cuddle on the couch, kiss on the balcony, make love on the bed, or a unique scene for each companion.
